# Character Gameplay

So, I had this project that is a remake from another project that was very messy and poorly optimized.
I decided redo that and split the development in smaller parts, as gameplay (this), level design and shaders, to 
get a cleaner workspace an focusing more in each part of the game

You can see the OLD project, and preview the locomotion scripts here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxL0rxCsU97rZyob3jnsqI7g3sJWGTQPL
