# Character Gameplay

So, I had this project that is a remake from anothe project that was very messy and poorly optimized.
I decided redo that and split the development in smaller parts, as gameplay (this), level design and shaders, to 
get a cleaner workspace an focusing more in each part of the game

You can see the OLD project, and preview the locomotion scripts here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb8Unh49JQKBipW0-7AMfcA
