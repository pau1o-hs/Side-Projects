# Coding Physics

Learn physics with Unity, this is a Physics class project (relate computing and physics), so I'm trying to make a rocket launch.
For while, already implemented gravity force and tragetory, discovering how physics works by trial and error is being painfully awesome.

No builds or videos for while
