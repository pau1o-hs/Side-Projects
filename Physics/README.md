# Coding Physics

Learning physics with Unity, this is a Physics class project (relate computing and physics), so I'm trying to make a rocket launch.
For while, already implemented gravity and velocity, linking to trajectory formula, making the rocket up and down. 
Discovering how physics works by trial and error is being painfully awesome.

No builds or videos for while, only codes
